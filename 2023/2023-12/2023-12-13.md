 - "word2vec" paper received the Test of Time Award from NeurIPS 2023. This paper started a new era for NLP and LM. Let me list the following paper working on this direction before LLM era.
    1. Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality(word2vec)
    1. GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation(Glove)
    1. Attention Is All You Need(Transformer)
    1. Learned in Translation: Contextualized Word Vectors(GoVe)
    1. Deep contextualized word representations(ELMo)
    1. Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training(GPT-1)
    1. BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding(BERT)
 - BTW, Paper _Are Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models a Mirage?_ received the _Outstanding Main Track Papers_,  there existed a huge debate in the middle of year about the emergent abilities about LLM.
